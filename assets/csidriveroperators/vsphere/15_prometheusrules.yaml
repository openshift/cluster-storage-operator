          description: |
            OpenShift has detected that an unsupported version of vSphere CSI driver is installed.
            It is OK to use this CSI driver for now, however, Red Hat does not support it.
            In a future OpenShift version it will be required to use OpenShift's version of the CSI
            driver to correctly migrate vSphere PersistentVolumes to CSI. Please consult OpenShift
            release notes before upgrading to the next version.
            To get a version of the CSI driver supported by Red Hat, uninstall the CSI driver,
            including its Deployment, DaemonSet and CSIDriver objects and OpenShift will
            automatically install a supported version of the CSI driver.

            vSphere topology is configured both in vSphere ClusterCSIDriver and Infrastructure
            objects. The topology in ClusterCSIDriver is ignored and only the one in
            Infrastructure object is used to configure the vSphere CSI driver. Please delete
            topology in ClusterCSIDriver, for example by
            "oc edit clustercsidriver csi.vsphere.vmware.com" and removing the whole
            "topologyCategories" section.
